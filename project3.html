                    <p class="mt-3 ">The development process is segmented into initial simulation setup,
                        programming the patrol behaviour, and real-world testing.
                    </p>

                    <h5><b>Simulation Setup</b></h5>
                    <p class="mt-3 "><b>Initial Actions:</b> The simulation environment in Gazebo is
                        configured to mimic real-world
                        scenarios,
                        allowing the robot’s patrol behaviour to be tested and refined. This involves launching the
                        simulation through ROS2 commands and ensuring the virtual Turtlebot3 is ready for programming.
                    </p>

                    <h5><b>Programming the Patrol Behavior</b></h5>
                    <p class="mt-3 "><b>Creating the ROS2 Package:</b> A package named robot_patrol was
                        developed, containing a C++ file
                        that defines the patrol behaviour. This includes subscribing to laser sensor topics to navigate
                        and
                        avoid obstacles based on the data received.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3 "><b>Algorithm Implementation:</b> A simple algorithm analyses 180 degrees
                        in front of the robot,
                        determining the safest direction by identifying the largest distance free of obstacles. This
                        direction guides the robot’s movement, ensuring continuous patrolling without collisions.
                        <br> Furthermore, Services and action goals were implemented to enhance the complexity for more
                        precision movements when patrolling.
                    </p>

                    <h5><b>Services for Robot Navigation </b></h5>
                    <p class="mt-3 "><b>Creating the Service:</b> Before creating the service a custom
                        service interface GetDirection.srv
                        was
                        created to take laser_data as request and direction as response. A ROS2 service server named
                        direction_service.cpp was developed in the same package. This service receives laser data from
                        the
                        Turtlebot3 and analyses it to determine the safest direction for the robot to move, enhancing
                        its
                        obstacle avoidance capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Integration with Patrol Behavior</b></p>

                    <p><b>Modifying the Patrol Script:</b> The existing patrol behaviour script,
                        patrol_with_service.cpp,
                        was
                        modified to include calls to the newly developed ROS2 service. This integration allows for
                        dynamic
                        obstacle avoidance based on real-time sensor data. After successfully testing the navigation
                        node in
                        simulation, it was deployed to the real robot.</p>

                    <h5><b>Actions for Position Goals</b></h5>
                    <p><b>Action Server Creation</b></p>
                    <p><b>Developing the Action Server:</b> An action server named go_to_pose_action.cpp was created.
                        This
                        server

                    <p><b>Deployment on the Real Robot:</b> Before real-world deployment, the patrol behaviour was
                        rigorously tested in the simulation to ensure reliable obstacle avoidance. After multiple
                        successful
                        simulation tests, the program was executed on an actual Turtlebot3 robot. This real-world test
                        was
                        conducted remotely, with the robot located in Barcelona, Spain, with the assistance of The
                        Construct
                        organization. Adjustments and debugging were carried out in real-time to adapt the patrol
                        behavior
                        to the nuances of the physical environment.

                <div class="container">
                    <p class="">The main objective of this project is to achieve a precise motion for the
                        turtlebot3 in a given setup. The project encapsulates basic ROS2 services and actions to control
                        a Turtlebot3 robot for autonomous patrolling and precise navigation to designated positions. The
                        robot uses Laserscan to identify the nearest obstacle, which then
                    </p>

                    <p>decides and navigates to the safest calculated distance. The goal is to enable the robot to
                        patrol a designated area while avoiding obstacles, demonstrated in both a simulated environment
                        and with a real Turtlebot3 robot.

                </div>

                <h5 class="mt-3"><b>Process and Development</b></h5>
                <p class="mt-3 ">The development process is segmented into initial simulation setup,
                    programming the patrol behaviour, and real-world testing.
                </p>

                <h5><b>Simulation Setup</b></h5>
                <p class="mt-3 "><b>Initial Actions:</b> The simulation environment in Gazebo is
                    configured to mimic real-world
                    scenarios,
                    allowing the robot’s patrol behaviour to be tested and refined. This involves launching the
                    simulation through ROS2 commands and ensuring the virtual Turtlebot3 is ready for programming.</p>

                <h5><b>Programming the Patrol Behavior</b></h5>
                <p class="mt-3 "><b>Creating the ROS2 Package:</b> A package named robot_patrol was
                    developed, containing a C++ file
                    that defines the patrol behaviour. This includes subscribing to laser sensor topics to navigate and
                    avoid obstacles based on the data received.</p>

                <p class="mt-3 "><b>Algorithm Implementation:</b> A simple algorithm analyses 180 degrees
                    in front of the robot,
                    determining the safest direction by identifying the largest distance free of obstacles. This
                    direction guides the robot’s movement, ensuring continuous patrolling without collisions.
                    <br> Furthermore, Services and action goals were implemented to enhance the complexity for more
                    precision movements when patrolling.
                </p>

                <h5><b>Services for Robot Navigation </b></h5>
                <p class="mt-3 "><b>Creating the Service:</b> Before creating the service a custom
                    service interface GetDirection.srv
                    was
                    created to take laser_data as request and direction as response. A ROS2 service server named
                    direction_service.cpp was developed in the same package. This service receives laser data from the
                    Turtlebot3 and analyses it to determine the safest direction for the robot to move, enhancing its
                    obstacle avoidance capabilities.
                </p>
                <p><b>Integration with Patrol Behavior</b></p>

                <p><b>Modifying the Patrol Script:</b> The existing patrol behaviour script, patrol_with_service.cpp,
                    was
                    modified to include calls to the newly developed ROS2 service. This integration allows for dynamic
                    obstacle avoidance based on real-time sensor data. After successfully testing the navigation node in
                    simulation, it was deployed to the real robot.</p>

                <h5><b>Actions for Position Goals</b></h5>
                <p><b>Action Server Creation</b></p>
                <p><b>Developing the Action Server:</b> An action server named go_to_pose_action.cpp was created. This
                    server
                    accepts goal positions and navigates the Turtlebot3 to these locations using odometry and velocity
                    commands, showcasing advanced robot control techniques.</p>

                <h5><b>Real-world Testing</b></h5>
                <p><b>Deployment on the Real Robot:</b> Before real-world deployment, the patrol behaviour was
                    rigorously tested in the simulation to ensure reliable obstacle avoidance. After multiple successful
